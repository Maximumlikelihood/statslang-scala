===============

LaTeX slides and Scala code for the 2014 RSS Statistical Computing Section Meeting on languages for statistical computing

The directory "slides" contains the LaTeX source code for the PDF slides presented at the meeting

The directory "monte-carlo" contains the Monte Carlo example from the talk

The directory "regression" contains the linear regression example from the talk

Note that this repo contains everything that is needed to build and run the Scala code examples on any system that has Java installed. Any recent version of Java is fine. You do not need to "install" Scala or any Scala "packages" in order to run the code. If you have Java, you are good to go. This is one of the benefits of Scala - you can run it anywhere, on any system with a Java installation. Further explanation is given in the talk slides.

README files within each directory give specific details for each case
